# README: Z-Test Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Z-Test**, a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large. The `Z_test_FDSA_assignment.ipynb` notebook covers hypothesis testing, statistical assumptions, and result interpretation.

## Features
- Performs **one-sample and two-sample Z-tests**.
- Calculates **Z-scores and p-values**.
- Defines **null and alternative hypotheses**.
- Uses **critical values** for hypothesis rejection.
- Visualizes test distributions and decision boundaries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for statistical computation.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive execution.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling.
- **Scipy & Statsmodels** for statistical testing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Z_test_FDSA_assignment.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to load data, calculate Z-scores, and interpret statistical results.
3. Modify dataset values to test different hypotheses.

## Future Enhancements
- Compare results with **T-tests** for small sample sizes.
- Automate statistical reporting with a summary table.
- Extend the project to cover **ANOVA and Chi-Square tests**.
- Use real-world datasets for practical applications.
